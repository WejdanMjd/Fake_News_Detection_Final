# Fake News Classifier üì∞

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning-based classifier to predict whether a given news article is **real** or **fake**. It leverages several popular machine learning models to achieve this classification, including traditional models like **Logistic Regression** and **Na√Øve Bayes**, as well as advanced models like **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Word2Vec-based models** combined with deep learning architectures like **Conv1D**.

## Models Used

The project evaluates the performance of the following models:

- **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes**
  - **Accuracy**: 95%
  
- **Logistic Regression**
  - **Accuracy**: 98.8%

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Accuracy**: 99.5%

- **Word2Vec + Conv1D**
  - **Accuracy**: 99.8%
  - **Loss**: 0.014

- **Word2Vec + Logistic Regression**
  - **Accuracy**: 95.11%

These models are compared to determine the best-performing approach for fake news detection.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is stored in the `data.csv` file and contains the following columns:

- **label**: 
  - `0` for Fake news
  - `1` for Real news
  
- **title**: The headline of the news article.
- **text**: The full content of the article.
- **subject**: The category or topic of the article (e.g., Politics, Technology, etc.).
- **date**: The publication date of the article.

The goal is to build a classifier that predicts whether a news article is real or fake based on the text data in this dataset.

### Example of a Data Entry:

| label | title                 | text                                                         | subject   | date       |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| 1     | "Real News Headline"   | "This is a real article with detailed news about current events." | Politics  | 2025-03-16 |
